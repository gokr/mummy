## This is a more complex example of using Mummy as a websocket server.
##
## WebSocket clients subscribe to a channel based on the url, eg /<channel_name>.
## Those clients will then receive any messages published to <channel_name>.
##
## Redis is used as the messaging hub so that multiple instances can run and
## messages can be pubished from other servers. To enable this, Redis PubSub
## is used. (Check out the Redis docs on that to learn more.)
##
## This server sends a heartbeat message to websocket clients at least every 30
## seconds. This ensure the connection stays open and active in a way websocket
## clients can check (for example, websocket Ping/Pong is not visible to JS).
