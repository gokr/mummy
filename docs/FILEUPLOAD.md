# Large File Upload Support Implementation Plan for Mummy

## Overview
Add comprehensive large file upload support to Mummy HTTP server with streaming, resumable uploads, and standards compliance.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Streaming Upload Handler Architecture
- Create `UploadHandler` type for streaming file processing
- Add `StreamingRequest` type that doesn't buffer body in memory
- Implement configurable upload directory management
- Add upload size limits and validation

### 1.2 Temporary File Management
- Implement atomic file operations (write to .tmp, rename on completion)
- Add unique upload ID generation (UUID-based)
- Create cleanup mechanisms for abandoned uploads
- Implement configurable temporary file retention policies

### 1.3 Chunked Transfer Enhancement
- Extend existing chunked transfer to support streaming to disk
- Add progress callbacks during chunk processing
- Implement backpressure handling for slow disk I/O
- Add configurable chunk size limits

## Phase 2: HTTP Standards Compliance (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1 Range Requests Support (RFC 7233)
- Implement `Range` header parsing
- Add partial upload capability using PATCH method
- Support `Content-Range` response headers
- Handle range validation and error responses

### 2.2 Content-Length Streaming
- Extend current Content-Length handling for streaming
- Add disk space validation before accepting uploads
- Implement progress tracking via file size monitoring
- Add upload rate limiting capabilities

### 2.3 Multipart Upload Enhancement
- Extend existing multipart support for streaming
- Add direct-to-disk file writing for multipart file fields
- Maintain backward compatibility with memory-based multipart
- Support mixed multipart (some fields memory, files to disk)

## Phase 3: Resumable Upload Protocol (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1 TUS Protocol Implementation
- Implement tus.io resumable upload protocol
- Add required headers: `Upload-Offset`, `Upload-Length`, `Tus-Resumable`
- Support POST (create), PATCH (append), HEAD (status) methods
- Add upload metadata handling

### 3.2 Upload Session Management
- Create upload session storage (file-based or configurable backend)
- Implement upload expiration and cleanup
- Add upload progress persistence
- Support upload cancellation and deletion

### 3.3 Error Recovery
- Add robust error handling for disk full, permission errors
- Implement upload integrity verification (checksums)
- Add automatic cleanup on failed uploads
- Support upload metadata validation

## Phase 4: Integration & API Design (Week 7)

### 4.1 Handler API Design
```nim
# Streaming upload handler
proc uploadHandler(request: StreamingRequest) =
  let upload = request.createUpload("uploads/", maxSize = 1.GB)
  upload.onProgress = proc(bytesReceived: int64) = echo "Progress: ", bytesReceived
  upload.onComplete = proc(finalPath: string) = echo "Upload complete: ", finalPath
  upload.stream() # Start streaming to disk

# Resumable upload handler
proc resumableHandler(request: Request) =
  case request.httpMethod:
  of "POST": request.createResumableUpload()
  of "PATCH": request.appendToUpload()
  of "HEAD": request.getUploadStatus()
```

### 4.2 Configuration Options
- Add upload configuration to `Server` constructor
- Support custom upload directories
- Configurable size limits and timeouts
- Optional resumable upload enable/disable

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (Week 8)

### 5.1 Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for streaming components
- Integration tests with large files (>1GB)
- TUS protocol compliance tests
- Performance benchmarks vs current implementation

### 5.2 Documentation
- Update README with large file upload examples
- Add streaming upload guide
- Document resumable upload API
- Performance characteristics documentation

## Technical Considerations

### Memory Safety
- Use bounded buffers for streaming (avoid unbounded growth)
- Implement proper cleanup in all error paths
- Add resource limits and monitoring

### Backwards Compatibility
- Maintain existing API for small uploads
- Add opt-in streaming for large uploads
- Preserve current multipart behavior by default

### Performance
- Minimize memory allocations during streaming
- Use efficient I/O operations (sendfile when possible)
- Add configurable buffer sizes for optimization

### Security
- Validate upload paths (prevent directory traversal)
- Add virus scanning hooks (optional)
- Implement upload rate limiting
- Add upload source IP tracking

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Streaming infrastructure and basic file handling
2. **Medium Priority**: TUS protocol and resumable uploads  
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced features like virus scanning hooks

This plan provides a solid foundation for enterprise-grade file upload capabilities while maintaining Mummy's performance and simplicity.

## HTTP Standards Reference

### RFC 7233 - Range Requests
- Defines partial content requests and responses
- Enables resumable downloads
- Foundation for resumable upload extensions

### TUS Protocol (tus.io)
- Open standard for resumable uploads
- Uses POST (create), PATCH (append), HEAD (status)
- Includes upload offset and length tracking
- Handles network interruption recovery

### RFC 7230/9112 - Chunked Transfer Encoding
- Enables streaming of unknown-length content
- Foundation for efficient upload streaming
- Already implemented in Mummy for basic use cases
